# Countries App 

## Description

This is a solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).

This app allows users to:

- See all countries on the homepage
- Search for a country
- Filter Countries By Region
- Click on the country card to see more information
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Switch between light and dark mode

## Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

## Some concepts that I put into practice

- Context, Providers and useContext hook
- Custom hooks

- Routing with React Router v6
- Local Storage
- Unit Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
